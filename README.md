# tracking-object using computer vision
##Object tracking in computer vision aims to estimate or predict the position of a target object in each consecutive frame of a video series. This process involves the following main stages:
Input: Provide video or live stream from a camera and preprocess each frame using OpenCV or another library.
Object Detection: Choose an object detection algorithm that classifies and detects the object by creating a bounding box around it.
Labeling: Assign a unique ID to each object that has been identified.
Appearance Modeling: Capture the visual appearance of the object to account for variations caused by lighting, perspective, or speed.
Tracking: Keep track of the detected object's movement through different frames while maintaining its relevant path.
There are two primary forms of object tracking:
Image-based tracking focuses on identifying, anchoring, and tracking an entire 2D image.
Video-based tracking, commonly referred to as real-time object tracking, estimates or predicts the position of a target object in each consecutive frame in a video.
Deep Learning methods, particularly LSTMs, have demonstrated success in object tracking by capturing temporal dependencies and handling long-term relationships among observations

. However, LSTMs alone cannot address all challenges associated with object tracking, such as occlusion, deformation, or illumination change; therefore, hybrid approaches that incorporate traditional computer vision techniques remain prevalent
